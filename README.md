# Block Run
This is the issue tracker for a minigame map called Block Run. If you have never played classic TNT run, it was based off of that and the idea is simple. Classically, a floor of sand or gravel would fall away as you ran accross it and the last person on top would be the winner! Using commands and data packs only, I have recreate this minigame in modern version of the game with any block and multiple areas to play at once.
